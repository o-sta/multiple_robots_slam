# multiple_robots_slam

## This packages need ros-kinetic and are used to do multiple-robots SLAM

<!-- 
#### "robot_name" require robot-number (ex. robot1, robot2, etc.)
#### "other_robot_name" require robot-number of wanting to know pose (ex. robot1, robot2, etc.)
#### "control_robot_name" require robot-number of wanting to teleoperate (ex. robot1, robot2, etc.)

- multi SLAM procedure

1. bringup

```
$ roslaunch multi_turtlebot_launch minimal.launch robot_name:=robot1
```

2. rtabmap

```
$ roslaunch multi_turtlebot_launch mapping.launch robot_name:=robot1
```

3. share topics and get other-robot pose ( Wait until all masters are displayed in "ROS masters obtained" )
```
$ roslaunch roscore_communication roscore_communication.launch robot_name:=robot1 other_robot_name:=robot2
```

4. merging maps ( launch after setting each robot's init-pose to "map_merge/launch/map_merge.launch")

```
$ roslaunch map_merge map_merge.launch robot_name:=robot1
```

- commands for expriment (two robots + server)

  - robot1

    ```
    $ roslaunch multi_turtlebot_launch minimal.launch robot_name:=robot1

    $ roslaunch multi_turtlebot_launch mapping.launch robot_name:=robot1

    $ roslaunch roscore_communication roscore_communication.launch robot_name:=robot1 server:=true

    $ roslaunch map_merge map_merge_robot.launch robot_name:=robot1 server:=true
    ```

  - robot2

    ```
    $ roslaunch multi_turtlebot_launch minimal.launch robot_name:=robot2

    $ roslaunch multi_turtlebot_launch mapping.launch robot_name:=robot2

    $ roslaunch roscore_communication roscore_communication.launch robot_name:=robot2 server:=true

    $ roslaunch map_merge map_merge_robot.launch robot_name:=robot2 server:=true
    ```
  - server

    ```
    $ roslaunch roscore_communication roscore_communication.launch robot_name:=robot1 server:=true

    $ roslaunch roscore_communication get_robot_pose.launch robot_name:=server other_robot_name:=robot1

    $ roslaunch roscore_communication get_robot_pose.launch robot_name:=server other_robot_name:=robot2

    $ roslaunch map_merge map_merge_server.launch

    $ roslaunch multi_turtlebot_launch teleop.launch robot_name:=server control_robot_name:=robot1

    $ roslaunch multi_turtlebot_launch teleop.launch robot_name:=server control_robot_name:=robot2

    $ rviz
    ```
